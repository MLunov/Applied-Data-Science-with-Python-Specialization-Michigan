# 2-5 [Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-plotting?specialization=data-science-python)
Course 2 of 5 in the [Applied Data Science with Python Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python)
## Syllabus
1. Module 1: Principles of Information Visualization[]()
> In this module, you will get an introduction to principles of information visualization. We will be introduced to tools for thinking about
design and graphical heuristics for thinking about creating effective visualizations. All of the course information on grading, prerequisites, 
and expectations are on the course syllabus, which is included in this module.
2. Module 2: Basic Charting[]()
> In this module, you will delve into basic charting. For this week’s assignment, you will work with real world CSV weather data. You will
manipulate the data to display the minimum and maximum temperature for a range of dates and demonstrate that you know how to create a line 
graph using matplotlib. Additionally, you will demonstrate the procedure of composite charts, by overlaying a scatter plot of record 
breaking data for a given year.
3. Module 3: Charting Fundamentals
> In this module you will explore charting fundamentals. For this week’s assignment you will work to implement a new visualization technique
based on academic research. This assignment is flexible and you can address it using a variety of difficulties - from an easy static image
to an interactive chart where users can set ranges of values to be used.
4. Module 4: Applied Visualizations[]()
> In this module, then everything starts to come together. Your final assignment is entitled “Becoming a Data Scientist.” This assignment
requires that you identify at least two publicly accessible datasets from the same region that are consistent across a meaningful dimension.
You will state a research question that can be answered using these data sets and then create a visual using matplotlib that addresses your
stated research question. You will then be asked to justify how your visual addresses your research question.
